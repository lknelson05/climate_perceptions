There are some good ones within the overall group.    Expand the education of the management biologist  out onto the boats that are doing the harvesting.    Manage the fishery to science rather than politics.    Remove/kill off the seas and sea lions that are homesteading the estuaries, rivers and spawning beds. These are the 'junk yard' bears of the ocean and cause tremendous damage especially in watersheds with stocks of concern.    Stop catch and release fisheries including commercial and sport. Mainly force the retaining of most of the catch and once quota is taken get the gear out of the water. This is especially important with the chinook and coho fishing but really all species of salmon and ground fish.    Force all by catch to be retained aboard then sold with a split in the moneys between the fisher and stock management.    Do a better job of accurately documenting the sport catch similar to what is done with commercial trollers.    Remove the politics as best possible from  DFO management decisions.    Do more test fisheries in areas that have been closed for years to define stock make up and health.    Do more stream counts on watersheds in remote areas to define stock health.    Review the hatchery process and support and expand hatcheries that are efficient.    Do more stream enhancement in remote watersheds.    Expand the harvest and timing through a voluntary draw process to define stocks and timing of runs in normally not fished areas. And do this via quota harvest not derby.    Get the fish farms onto land based processes with good filtration of effluent.    Ensure plants processing farm fish have excellent filtration of effluent.    Turn all salmon fisheries into quota base not derby.    Define why kelp is disappearing from this coast. Has been going on for the  last 45 years starting in the south and progressing north. May be ocean warming but more likely other causes too? Get the blinders off the biologist that presently are locked in the Global warming explanation for everything. Too often people find what they believe is happening rather than what the actually causes are.    A fund needs to be developed to pay native fishers to start as deckhands in the fisheries to learn the business on select vessels. At some point these students would be able to run their own boats with financial assistance from the government.","In particular the troll fishing could be a great cottage industry, especially frozen at sea troll caught fish. Getting more natives trained in this type of fishery with a lot of thought and restructuring of the access would accomplish a number of goats. But it would take planning, commitment and follow through.    I think the fish are there in harvest able numbers in a well thought out and managed harvest through. It would need to be done via quota along with some intelligent marketing of 'white linen' markets plus local marketing.     It requires people thinking 'out of the box'. I think it would be viable for a limited number of eventual native owned and operated vessel. But, it requires good planning and committed folks on all sides. They would need to be committed natives, knowledgeable committed fishers,  eager government personnel and  marketing folks.     A small group of people from each of these four groups would need to put the process together so they 'owned' it for a few years till it became a working enterprise.    I think eventually small cottage type entities are the future of the commercial salmon fishery. The old derby, best boats take all, is dead. Something new needs to emerge or the whole this whole green industry will disappear.",6472.419,4,NA,10,NA,5,6,"03/19/2020 17:22","Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/80.0.3987.149 Safari/537.36"

Extremes in climate also create the perfect storm of food production in isolated circumstances which seems to contribute to certain salmon stocks hitting the jackpot and doing really well. The resident whales dependent on a steady stream of migratory salmon to feed on through out the year have no chance right now. They don't have the ability to feed on and store enough food from 1 successful salmon run to survive. They need more consistent average returns of this food source through out the year.  As fisherman the only way to survive now is to be able to move from region to region and participate in the bumper crop returns.
